            Iâ€™m a passionate front-end developer with a flair for creative
            design and implementation. I thrive on transforming beautiful ideas
            into stunning realities, blending aesthetics with functionality.
            Beyond coding, I channel my creativity into home design and general
            decorations, where my keen eye for detail ensures every project is
            both visually captivating and meticulously crafted.
